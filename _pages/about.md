I'm a PhD candidate in the Physics department at Stanford University, conducting research in X-ray Astronomy and Observational Cosmology within KIPAC. My main focus is Galaxy Clusters, producing spatially-resolved measurements of the Intracluster Medium (ICM) with existing Flagship X-ray telescopes (namely Chandra and XMM-Newton). 

I'm particularly interested in how cluster environments evolve in the presence of feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and other energetic processes that can affect morphology, thermodynamics, and chemical abundances within the intracluster gas. I strive to expand the X-ray coverage of clusters to the highest redshifts possible in order to probe theories of self-similar evolution and cosmic enrichment.

I'm invested in developing new modeling techniques for our existing instruments to extract the most information possible in the current generation, and I seek to apply these methods generally to the next generation of X-ray space missions. In particular, I'm a member of the working groups for the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) a proposed NASA Probe-class mission that will revolutionize how we see the X-ray Universe with it's high sensitivity and exquisite spatial resolution.
